# Randomness in Computers

Randomness in computer is a little exploration research into how computers generate random numbers. This is by no means a comprehensive study, but rather a collection of notes and code snippets that I have found interesting.

You can welcome to contribute and hey, I hope it eventually becomes a comprehensive study.
